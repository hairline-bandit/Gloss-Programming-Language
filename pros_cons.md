## Pros: 
+ Syntax heavy; most code looks the same and is therefore easy to read
+ Built with small files
+ Less characters per line
+ Less "hard to hit" characters
+ Uses a text (.txt) file to store the code; can be edited with any text editor on any machine
+ As it converts to a ".go" file, after compilation it can be ran on any machine with the GoLang compiler
+ No pesky import statements to remember

## Cons:
- Syntax heavy; spaces in some places break the parser
- Formatting code for indents and brackets is stupidly hard to read
- Slow runtime due to the fact that it is passed through multiple slow languages to compile and run
- Uses Powershell to control everything; the "hq.ps1" file will only work on Windows
- Not much function; this is a toy language
- No IDE; why would there be, this is a toy language
