# Gloss-Programming-Language

As of 4/16/21 WIP 

Works by parsing a text file and converting it to its equivalent in GoLang. Powershell script will control everything by executing python script on text file and then executing GoLang file

For anyone wondering why I didn't use Flex, Bison, and LLVM, it's because I don't know C (That's also why implementation language is Python and GoLang) and also because I was too lazy to learn them. This is also a lot easier to make as (let's be honest here) most programming languages are basically the same, but with what does what changed. This essentially means that I can use a script to parse and then quite easily turn the commands into commands in a different language.
